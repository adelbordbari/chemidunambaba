If you can see this page, you probably already know me.

This is where I write briefly and/or extensively about the albums I listen to. This mostly will include the new albums I "discover" and not the more well-known pieces I've heard during past years, namely a lot of Pink Floyd, Tool, and Radiohead.
The longer I write, the more I've enjoyed (and as a result dug deeper) the album. However, the general criteria for rating the albums are as follows:
  
1. During the process, was I interested in listening to what the album has to provide?
2. Did I face something new? Was it enough of a "discovery"?
3. Was the album an artistic masterpiece? was it a technically well-crafted piece?
4. Will I remember the album? will I want to listen to it again?
5. Did it change the person I am?
