## Preface
a pretty short sweet album. not too fancy but humble and honest. sounds good, sounds a lot like The Smiths but still "new" to not be fully predictable. **A Rush and a Push and the Land Is Ours** and **Last Night I Dreamt** are perfect tracks.
It's not too consistent for an album. they're mostly love songs but also include hints about political and personal issues. I didn't particularly dislike it but I was expecting more, hopefully, my next Smiths album listen (**The Queen Is Dead**) will be my favorite.

## Review
My first Smiths album! starts with **A Rush and a Push and the Land Is Ours**, a very sweet love song. typical: romantic, romantic, and honestly a bit whiny. the keyboards sound like guitars. The song titles are too long. **I Started Something I Couldn't Finish** is very harsh. a sudden ending, relative to the previous track. Morrissey sings weirdly at some points.

> Typical me, I started Something  
> And now, I'm not too sure

I don't quite understand **Death of a Disco Dancer** in the context of the album, the text is also a bit too repetitive: "_oh, very nice, very nice, very nice_", "_in the next world, in the next world_". I like his voice though, easily recognizable and pretty melancholic. it's about a bombing in London: the INLA bombing of the Dropping Well disco in December 1982. the disco was visited by British Army soldiers from the nearby Barracks.
**Girlfriend In A Coma** is very upbeat! I knew they have this "happy music, sad lyrics" but one's literally a dance song. **Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One Before** starts making the album sound boring, I know exactly what's coming on next. ah, **Last Night I Dreamt**... I had heard this song before many times, it's a favorite, a unique, pretty long intro. I love the crowd noises, it's very alienating. everyone living and screaming and fighting and here's a dude playing sad piano revisiting his dream.

> Last night I dreamt that somebody loved me...  
> Last night I felt real arms around me  
> No hope, no harm, just another false alarm

The text is brilliant, the percussion reverb, everything fits really nicely together. masterpiece. I hate that it ended.

> The story is old, I know  
> But it goes on, and on

**Unhappy Birthday** sounds funny. I like the rhythm, very proto-punk but I'm here for the sad songs and this one isn't particularly one of them. **Paint A Vulgar Image** is about the music industry. very straightforward. he was a fan and now he's a star and one day he will be a dead star, he's all the characters. ironic how they also have many compilations and reissues.
**Death At One's Elbow** is very American and bluesy. features harmonica and the guitars also make him sound like Elvis. **I Won't Share You** is sweet and cute, it sounds honest and naked. the album ends with the same echo effect it started with.
