## Preface
1h 5m, 17 tracks, beautiful album cover. It's the journey of a guy on a road switching between radio stations: great idea for a concept album. A bit too American for me. No significant musicianship except for Grohl's drums; However! results in an overall recognizable sound with a solid mix.

## Review
Starts weirdly, with a radio, very annoying and loud. It's a concept album. **No One Knows**, the second track has an amazing riff. The album has a great mix, headbanging bass and drums. I think the album is a critic of the music industry, _"songs that sound like everyone else"_, _"so many rules, this and that, these and those"_

I think it could be shorter. It's very riff-based, with simple guitar rhythms (but still precise and on point) but very creative drumming, especially during the intro for Songs For The Dead, my favorite so far, super kick-ass and heavy. With tracks 4 and 5 I feel like it's about a more broad topic: the music industry.

> Life's the study of dying

feels more mellow in **The Sky Is Fallin'**, more melodic. vocals are quieter than the music. turns more sad and nihilistic:

> Close your eyes and see the skies are fallin'

The radio once again reminds me that we're still not done with the album. **Six Shooter** isn't my favorite, too angry, noisy, and weird. Although it's only one minute long. The previous track mentioned "death metal all the time", this is the death metal. **Hanging Tree** sounds good, It still has simple guitars but sounds more progressive. The guitars are still too loud.

OK, apparently these are the different radio stations! each playing slightly different genres but since it's one band playing, "they all sound like everyone else", wow. That's why **Six Shooter** was so different.

The tracks don't feel annoyingly long, the album is one hour long but it feels alright since each single track is rather short.

> It's so safe to play along, Little soldiers in a row, Falling in and out of love, Something sweet to throw away

It's starting to feel boring with **Gonna Leave You**, I want it to end soon, the only song so far with a solo: is very distorted and dirty, It fits the atmosphere.

I like the singing in **Do It Again**. **God Is In The Radio** sounds scary with a great solo and a marching rhythm. **Another Love Song** sounds smooth and more listenable, the vocals sound more raw.

> You're just another love song

The ending in that song is odd and rather creepy, it gives me BDSM vibes.

> This is WOMB, The Womb. And if you, my pets, learn to listen. I'll let you crawl back in. Here is something you should drop to your knees for, and worship. But you are too stupid to realize yourselves.

The title track! great buildup. The album ends here, though few "hidden songs" exist at the end. **Mosquito Song** is calm, Celtic, and quiet. Very beautiful chorus. Sounds exactly the opposite of other songs: every instrument plays its role, slightly mysterious, more acoustic sounds. Reminds me of the beginning of the album when a Mexican guy talked on the radio. My second favorite track. Although I think it's almost offensive to have the hidden song as my favorite, isn't it?

The other two songs are live performances that sound more like the album. There's not much to add, although feels like a cool breeze to put away the disc and have a smooth goodbye.

> I'm taking my song to the grave.

I can't pick one song as my favorite because honestly, this album stays very loyal to the notion of _a concept album_, and despite minor _genre variations_, it's one long piece.

I almost didn't like it, except for the few songs that sounded heavy and good for headbanging. I gradually liked it less while listening since those few headbanging "sounds" also started to wear off and sound a bit boring.
