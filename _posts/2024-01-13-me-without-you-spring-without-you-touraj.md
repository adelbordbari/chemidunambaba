## Preface
This album has been released in 2022, almost 50 years after its initial recording. I didn't know Touraj was a singer too, I have heard much of his composed music for other singers of course. this is a bundle of several songs, a few are very brilliant (the title track, The Garden, The Distance) and I heard multiple songs during my listen. It's a nice gesture overall, I enjoyed some moments I didn't expect too much either. The most interesting thing, in my opinion, is how bluesy/psychedelic it is while trying to maintain its Eastern roots; like much of what was recorded at the time. I like the mix, it sounds a lot like the mainstream later 60s psychedelic rock, but instead, someone sings in Farsi! the lyrics don't have much to offer except a handful of lines in the songs I mentioned above.

## Review
Starts pretty much like a 60's psychedelic song: acoustic guitar, present organs, bluesy electric guitar, huge bass, and harsh left/right channel mix. The first track, **Take a Blue Handkerchief** (دستمال آبی بردار) sounds slightly sad. I don't understand the lyrics and the ending is a bit weird. I like the melodies but sometimes it feels a bit too Western (e.g. the last minute with the piano and palm-muted guitars).

**Dream of the Alley** is slightly more solid, better structured, and better drumming. the violin is sweet and contributes to the romantic theme of the piece. the drops are powerful and he sings with better control. I enjoy the cracks in his voice, it feels intimate and honest. the drumfils are stunning in this one! the lyrics are also more straightforward and intentional.
The title track, **Me Without You, The Spring Without You**, the reason why I decided to listen to the album. I like it. the phrasing on the classical guitar creates a flowing conversation and the clarinet fills the empty spaces well. it has a great mix. I wonder why these were not released for nearly five decades. the lyrics and vocals are both very vulnerable. I noticed how all the songs so far have a slightly _happier chorus_, including the title track.

The next song sounds very Arabic. titled "The Desert", I think it should. Resembles the more famous "Kavir" from Googoosh. it's a bit weird because it has nothing to do with its beginning, except the lyrics. I love the strings on **The Omen**. it has fewer instruments, sounds more lonely, and a bit brighter. the chorus is a little strange, the build-up could be stronger and more decisive. it sounds like a raw collage of ideas.

**My Beloved Feathered**, strange title! it has Tabla in it which is, again, a bit more Arab/Afghan. it's better constructed and glued together. I like the instrumental section in the middle, the melodies are rich and the organs fit with the clarinet and tablas. Like every other song, this one also ends with a fadeout.

**The Unique Gem** starts with a brilliant guitar intro. every section is great! after a few verses, there's an instrumental part that's amazing. it's both very Western and very Eastern at the same time. it could be from both Riyadh and London. the downtempo section afterward brings out the great steady vocals. it sounds like a mystic, mournful lullaby. in the end, everything gives in, a bit faster, feels like the piece is preparing itself for some grand event. the distorted vocals are a bit weird but it cools down for the final verse, and it suddenly ends! **Take My Lonely Hand** is very solid, it could be the second single for the album. not very different than the other tracks but still manages to keep its own DNA. the writing is a little sloppy. this one also ends with a fadeout.
So far it's not much of an "album", as far as I bother with the idea of _listening to an album_. **The Distance** is brilliant! the lyrics are on point, it hits hard. I love how thick the bass is and he sings beautifully in this one. He sings as if he's been just crying, very emotional. I listened to it multiple times before moving any further. just awesome. I especially love the high-tempo part in the middle and the higher-register verses at the end.

**The Garden** has a beautiful intro and a traditional atmosphere. including Tonbak and the slow Iranian rhythm, it sounds like the typical pop/traditional Farsi song. there's an interesting bright moment after the second chorus.
Generally, I had a hard time listening to this because it's a bit more than the amount of Farsi music that I usually listen to.
**Not Anymore** features heavy guitars which is pretty rare in this context. the music is a bit too loud, even annoying at some points. very beautiful chorus, I love how the melody counters the chords. it sounds a lot like the music of that era. It's also so easy to recognize his unique style of writing melodies in his head. in terms of form, this album is amazing too. I have no idea what they mean by "pre-recorded" but I assume the songs have been finished to a great degree, and only slight surface changes are included in this release because they already sound so rich! it sounds a lot like Fereydoun Foroughi too, and I'm glad it exists.
**Swallows In Love** shows very vividly how his famous songs are created. this one for example sounds a lot like a few of Shohre's hit songs.

It seems like he loved **The Garden** because there's an instrumental version present as well. it sounds nostalgic and solemn. I love the flute and the sense of storytelling in it. there's a weird cut in the middle which I think is the result of sparsely recorded tracks. The album ends with "The Tale", it's very minimalistic. piano and violins are the only instruments that accompany the vocals for the intro. then bass and drums join in. quite a pattern in this album.
