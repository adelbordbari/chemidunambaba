## Preface
Released in 2007, 50 minutes in 13 tracks. Suggested by a friend, but I almost regret listening to it. It wasn't hard to go through the album but well, nothing important or memorable either. It's like some guy in his 20s sitting down in his bedroom and making this after a week of mouse clicks and wiggling knobs.

I like to feel good about these, but they still sound unstructured and lazy to me. It's not "bad", so to say, only not significant. I can pause the music, come back an hour later, continue listening, and not feel the gap. Electronic remains a non-favorite genre for now. It's simply too lazy and improperly bundled.

## Review
I haven't heard a lot of electronic music, very selectively and sparsely. It starts a bit weird, but the first five minutes are enough for me to connect. the ethereal strings and drum machine patterns that resemble Kid A. **Near Dark** sounds a lot like the second, but I like the melody better. it's hard for me to not think of it as lazy, but let's find out. it follows the same "form", I find the last minutes repetitive again, and a sudden fade out.

**Ghost Hardware** is slightly different but still similar, simpler, and easier to listen to. Reminds me of _La La La La_ by _Naughty Boy_. **Endorphine** is odd; I can't follow the structure. things just happen and a baby voice randomly comes and goes.

This is essentially elevator music at this point. I started learning to enjoy it once I stopped actively listening! The songs aren't distinguishable, all like one blob of sounds: human voice with altered pitch, drum machine, and old-timey strings.

**In McDonald's** has a pretty good intro, more familiar to my ears. **Untrue**, the title track is rather decent. it ends right when I start to feel like _"Come on, enough of this"_. I like the ending section in **Shell Of Light**. **Dog Shelter** is very wet, with vinyl scratches. The second half from **Homeless** is nice, but still nothing seriously amazing.

**Raver** is maybe my second favorite, though it feels like a loop that repeats several times. I like the sample, but what I dislike is how it cools down and makes me think it's gonna end but then again it does not(?) and loops once more.
