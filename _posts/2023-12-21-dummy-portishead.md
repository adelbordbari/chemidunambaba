## Preface
I didn't like it very much. 49 minutes; it's almost very simple and forgettable. I liked the same two tracks I've heard before, **Glory Box** and **Roads**; maybe **Strangers** too. it didn't have many great moments, only a few original authentic ideas. it sounds good, that's the best thing I can say.

## Review
**Mysterons** very quickly gives up the DJ turntable. the sinewave sounds like a ghost whispering throughout the lyrics, watching us from afar. Beth Gibbons sounds alarming, she's talking about a serious subject. I think it's the British Empire since there's something very British about how they sound: "_This ocean will not be grasped_", also because Mysterons were apparently a Martian race, the antagonist from a 60s TV show.

**Sour Times** sounds very different. it's maybe sampled from a French/Italian song? it makes me think of a cafe at night with the seats out on the sidewalk. it sounds like a Western film score too. I still can think of the album being about Britain: "_I have left is my memories of yesterday_", "_end the vows... take a shot_". the songs aren't very complicated but original. it's not hard to hear that certain early 90s "Bristol sound".

> The song uses a sample from Argentine composer Lalo Schifrin’s “Danube Incident”

I wasn't very wrong about that European feel. the electronic alarming sound still wanders through the sounds.
I've heard a live performance of **Strangers**, which was fascinating. it perfectly captures the band's DNA. Beth's iconic shaky "ou"s, jazzy guitars, and the electronic glue that ties everything together.

> Can anybody see the light?  
> Where the morn' meets the dew and the tide rises

this reminded me of the saying "the sun never sets in the Empire", this could be a political narrative. let's see.

**It Could Be Sweet** sounds a lot like 90s hip-hop, especially the high-pitched string samples. it's a bit dissonant.

> And I ain't guilty of the crimes you accuse me of  
> But I'm guilty of fear

**Wandering Star** also has the _red alert_ siren type of sound. **It's A Fire** is pretty bluesy with the organ but quickly sounds like the rest of the album: dissonant, electronic, and sci-fi scary. I like it best after the first track, it's more melodic and at ease.

**Numb** is very authentic, it stands on its own. maybe because of the solid rhythm, maybe because of the tin can snare sound. I can't understand the lyrics, except by accepting that it means literally what it says, romantic cliche. the whole album sounds very minimal but still unique.

I've heard **Roads** before (like everyone else?) and I love it. it sounds more accessible and singable. the drums, guitars, strings, the build-up in the middle, singing, form, all of it sounds more normal. again very simple lyrics, just one verse and one chorus that's repeated three times. I always liked the ending bass, it's simple and on point.

> We've got a war to fight

**Pedestal** starts really interesting. so much bass, the delay on the vocals works perfectly. I also like how they suddenly switch to a disk scratch(?) section without any foreshadowing and then go back to the original sound. I love this one too, the form is great.

> Haunted, I tell myself, yet I still wander  
> Down inside

so far, it doesn't say much. it sounds recognizable and simple.
Before **Glory Box**, I was feeling asleep. I've heard this one too, I love it. she sings a bit differently in this one. even the verses align with my political theme idea. there's finally a solo, which of course follows the agenda: simple, minimal, and individual. the song fades out, and the album ends. I still can think that she's singing to Britain, although the sound character doesn't fit this theme. it's not angry, not mature. I'm probably wrong but I like how it stands even until the ending lines:

> We're all looking at a different picture  
> Through this new frame of mind  
> A thousand flowers could bloom  
> Move over and give us some room, yeah
