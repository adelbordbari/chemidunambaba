This is where I write briefly and/or extensively about the albums I listen to. This mostly will include the new albums I "discover" and not the more well-known pieces I've heard during past years, namely a lot of Pink Floyd, Tool, and Radiohead.

The longer I write, the more I've enjoyed (and as a result dug deeper) the album. However, the general criteria for rating the albums are as follows:

1. during the process, was I interested in listening to what the album has to provide?
2. did I face something new? Was it enough of a "discovery"?
3. was the album an artistic masterpiece? was it a technically well-crafted piece?
4. will I remember the album? will I want to listen to it again?
5. did it change the person I am?

## 1. Woyaya - Osibisa (⭐️⭐️⭐️/5)

Upbeat cool West African rock. starts smoothly, moves ahead strongly, and farewells the listener with a sense of nostalgia, as if it's saying "We're going to meet again". 7 tracks, 40 minutes long. It sounds a lot like reggae, Caribbean music, and highlife.

**25 Nov 2023**: I particularly liked **Spirits Up Above**, the first half of **Survival**, **Rabiatu**: tracks 3, 4 and 6. **Spirits Up Above** has a bluesy guitar that's very familiar, the sing-along in the first half is so interesting and sounds a lot like gospel (or Ray Charles for that matter). It starts with a familiar introduction, in the middle presents its main _interesting sound_ and during the last two tracks a less _present_ more _background music_ sort of outro, like a gentle goodbye.

I like the instrumentation, it's a blend of African instruments and mainstream Western instruments; Just enough of both sides so I can notice that it's following the world and still values its roots. The lyrics are minimal, almost absent but on point.

It felt good, nothing too deep or fancy, very authentic, memorable, and new.

## 2. Songs For The Deaf - Queens Of The Stone Age (⭐️⭐️⭐️/5)

1h 5m, 17 tracks, beautiful album cover. It's the journey of a guy on a road switching between radio stations: great idea for a concept album. A bit too American for me. No significant musicianship except for Grohl's drums; However! results in an overall recognizable sound with a solid mix.

<img id="cover" alt="album cover" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/01/Queens_of_the_Stone_Age_-_Songs_for_the_Deaf.png">

**26 Nov 2023**: Starts weird, with a radio, very annoying and loud. It's a concept album. **No One Knows**, the second track has an amazing riff. The album has a great mix, headbanging bass and drums. I think the album is a critic of the music industry, "songs that sound like everyone else", "so many rules, this and that, these and those"

I think it could be shorter. It's very riff-based, with simple guitar rhythms (but still precise and on point) but very creative drumming, especially during the intro for Songs For The Dead, my favorite so far, super kick-ass and heavy. With tracks 4 and 5 I feel like it's about a more broad topic: the music industry.

> Life's the study of dying

feels more mellow in **The Sky Is Fallin'**, more melodic. vocals are quieter than the music. turns more sad and nihilistic:

> Close your eyes and see the skies are fallin'

The radio once again reminds me that we're still not done with the album. **Six Shooter** isn't my favorite, too angry, noisy, and weird. Although it's only one minute long. The previous track mentioned "death metal all the time", this is the death metal. **Hanging Tree** sounds good, It still has simple guitars but sounds more progressive. The guitars are still too loud.

OK, apparently these are the different radio stations! each playing slightly different genres but since it's one band playing, "they all sound like everyone else", wow. That's why **Six Shooter** was so different.

The tracks don't feel annoyingly long, the album is one hour long but it feels alright since each single track is rather short.

> It's so safe to play along, Little soldiers in a row, Falling in and out of love, Something sweet to throw away

It's starting to feel boring with **Gonna Leave You**, I want it to end soon, the only song so far with a solo: is very distorted and dirty, It fits the atmosphere.

I like the singing in **Do It Again**. **God Is In The Radio** sounds scary with a great solo and a marching rhythm. **Another Love Song** sounds smooth and more listenable, the vocals sound more raw.

> You're just another love song

The ending in that song is odd and rather creepy, gives me BDSM vibes.

> This is WOMB, The Womb. And if you, my pets, learn to listen. I'll let you crawl back in. Here is something you should drop to your knees for, and worship. But you are too stupid to realize yourselves.

The title track! great buildup. The album ends here, though few "hidden songs" exist at the end. **Mosquito Song** is calm, Celtic, and quiet. Very beautiful chorus. Sounds exactly the opposite of other songs: every instrument plays its role, slightly mysterious, more acoustic sounds. Reminds me of the beginning of the album when a Mexican guy talked on the radio. My second favorite track. Although I think it's almost offensive to have the hidden song as my favorite, isn't it?

The other two songs are live performances that sound more like the album. There's not much to add, although feels like a cool breeze to put away the disc and have a smooth goodbye.

> I'm taking my song to the grave.

I can't pick one song as my favorite because honestly, this album stays very loyal to the notion of _a concept album_, and despite minor _genre variations_, it's one long piece.

I almost didn't like it, except for the few songs that sounded heavy and good for headbanging. I gradually liked it less while listening since those few headbanging "sounds" also started to wear off and sound a bit boring.

## 3. The Velvet Underground & Nico - The Velvet Underground (⭐️/5)

Too avant-garde for me, has its moments but I enjoyed something like 10 minutes of it. Not really my thing, both thematically(prostitutes, sexual masochism, and heroine) or musically(long and drone-y). It was like an audible Jackson Pollock for me(yes, and not an audible Warhol).

I acknowledge the role it historically played with Warhol and his "factory" but as music, I don't think I'd listen to it much in the future, except the few long-time favorites: Venus in Furs and Waiting For The Man.

It is certainly new for me(and was at its time) but merely "new" isn't enough. They say "disobey" and "destroy the traditions", but that makes sense only when one creates better traditions. Destroy, yes, but only so you can build better on top of the ashes; and not for the sake of destruction itself.

<img id="cover" alt="album cover" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0c/Velvet_Underground_and_Nico.jpg">

**04 Dec 2023**: Nico sings a lot like Lou Reed, "atonal whining". 11 songs, 49 minutes, decent standard length.

The first track has sweet melodies with the celesta intro, and a weird reverb all of a sudden in the second verse. I had heard **I'm waiting for the man** before, very noisy and drone-y. reminds me of his ostrich guitar. loud, compared to the next track that's very smooth. the lyrics are however in contrast, amplifying the idea of **Femme Fatale**.

**Venus In Furs** has always been a favorite of mine. sounds like no other band, with catchy repetitive sections, and Reed's singing is also iconic and unmistakable. continues with the idea of sexual masochism. feels a bit eastern in the middle. minimal and solid **Run Run Run** sounds heavier than others, more raw singing. weird solo with the same repeating rhythms as previous tracks.

Generally, I'm not very fond of the themes: sex, drugs, and sadomasochism but I'm trying to follow along. It's not even symbolic or anything, straight-up heroine and overdoes and whipping.

**All Tomorrow's Parties** has the same structure: minimal tribal percussions, repeating rhythms, tambourine, lazy guitar like it's the first take and diatonic singing. Her singing also feels very German and folk-like, I'm starting to feel a bit bored by the end, 6 minutes is almost a lot. I kinda like the guitars! It sounds sloppy but it works here.

**Heroin** is so catchy, same pattern but the tempo changes are amazing. sometimes sloppy and not synchronized. for me, the climax is when he says _"heroin be the death of me"_. The distorted violins and at the end, the calmness fade out. the album could end here as far as I'm concerned. very wordy, which addresses Reed's writing spirit.

so far, it's been trying to depict its time, geography, and theme: little expressions, names, prices, and places, every detail builds a bridge for me to what they lived.
**There She Goes Again** is more hearable, nice lyrics and more diverse rhythmic patterns.

> There she goes again  
> She's knocked out on her feet again  
> She's down on her knees, my friend  
> But you know she'll never ask you please again

To me **The Black Angels' Death Song** sounds very, Scottish(?) for some reason. **European Son** is also way too avant-garde for my ears, cool bassline though. After a few minutes, I thought to myself "Yeah I don't have to listen to this", but realized it was only the middle of the song. it's like several deaf people playing for themselves.

I could sum up the album along these lines:

> I che che, che che I, Che che che, ka tah koh  
> Choose to choose, Choose to choose, choose to go

## 4. Stranger - Billy Joel (⭐️⭐️⭐️/5)

Totally worth the time and attention, I will hear some of these songs again. I heard **Vienna** years ago and it's been my favorite since then. the whole album has that mood. a certain melancholic longing but with one's chin up. it's not a desperate break-up sadness, it's more fundamental. it's longing for love, peace, and youth. it celebrates having a dream of your own, as the last song goes:

> And I know that everybody has a dream  
> And this is my dream, my own  
> Just to be at home  
> And to be all alone  
> All alone with you, oh  
> With you

<img id="cover" alt="album cover" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f5/Thestranger1977.jpg">

**06 Dec 2023**: I've heard **Vienna** before, it's an all-time favorite of mine. I'm expecting a lot of piano and great lyrics. 9 songs, 42 minutes, perfect album length. **Movin' Out** is a bit dance-y, I love his singing. it's very soulful, intimate, and articulate. it talks of how everyone works their lives _only_ for money, and the character _moves out_, of the house but it's a metaphor for how he wants to break free.

> Who needs a house out in Hackensack  
> Is that all you get for your money?

With the second track, comes the expected piano, the title track. beautiful intro with a melancholic whistling melody. straightforward lyrics. a new form of rhyming for me:

``
Verse:

1===m
2===X
3===n
4===Y
1===o
2===X
3===p
4===Y
``

**Just The Way You Are** sounds very personal. as if he's telling a real story from his own life. it speaks of simplicity and how we usually forget to appreciate it, of how it is to want simple things, to _be the way we are_ and to be loved for it.

> I don't want clever conversation  
> Never want to work that hard, mm  
> I just want someone that I can talk to  
> I want you just the way you are

**Scenes From Italian Restaurant** sounds like a rainy day in New York, the strings, the sax solo, everything; it could be the soundtrack to a sitcom. however at 7 minutes, it's very long, but it gets interesting with the middle section (Brenda and Eddie), and the return at the end is even better. the sax really works with the transitions.

huh, **Vienna**... it's very nostalgic for me, it makes me wanna cry. very strong lyrics (p.s. it did make me cry right now)

**Only The Good Die Young** sounds more upbeat, a good move from the melancholy of the previous track. this one made me smile, and laugh even. it's saying to the girl that you will sin eventually, I might as well be it! funny.

> Come out Virginia, don't let me wait  
> You Catholic girls start much too late  
> Sooner or later it comes down to fate  
> I might as well be the one

**She's Always A Woman** beautiful love song, smooth and with a cool fade out. **Get It Right The First Time** sets the happier mood after a sadder song once again, something that has repeated for few times now. almost a Caribbean atmosphere, later confirmed with the instruments. well captures the rush of first impressions. the pre-chorus is interesting, "I've got to give it one good try", _it_ being the chorus and his first impression of the girl.
The last track is very concert-y, with the crowds singing a repeating line. I knew it was the last song after hearing the chorus. once again, very beautiful strong lyrics. not too bright, not too sad. both optimistic, realistic, and human. beyond time and place, touches the deeper side of the listener's mind. I felt like I needed to quote many of the lines, and for good reason: they're awesome.

> While in these days of quiet desperation  
> As I wander through the world in which I live  
> I search everywhere for some new inspiration  
> But it's more than cold reality can give  
> If I need a cause for celebration  
> Or a comfort I can use to ease my mind  
> I rely on my imagination  
> And I dream of an imaginary time

oh, it's two different songs, sounds familiar. it's the intro from another track that had a whistle YES ok there's the whistle. that's how the album ends: sad, hopeful, simple, intimate, nostalgic.
